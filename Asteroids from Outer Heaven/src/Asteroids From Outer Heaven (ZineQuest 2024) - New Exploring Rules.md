# Moving Around the Map
- 1 Hex per day. Taking up as many recourses as expected. (1 supply per day per player, etc.)
- If you want to go faster, you can Push your mech to move more then 1 space. Roll a d20 for each additional hex they move. If you roll a 10 or less, One system malfunctions. If all systems are broken, then the mech takes 1 point of Structure Damage.
# Scrap Hunting
- Scrap is heaped all over the planet of __ . From destroyed mechs fighting over the AI, to the falling pieces.
- Players need to collect and trade Scrap in order to repair their mechs and barter certain things with. Roughly to the tune of 2 sessions exploring or 1 session in a Facility = 1LL. [[Asteroids From Outer Heaven - Module Trading]]
# Asteroids From Outer Heaven
- The Union Outer Heaven is dead, blown to the nuclear fire of its core, and its pieces are falling towards. 
- Every time a clock is filled, The GM rolls 2d20 and places a wreckage point at that point on the map. Fundamentally, the players need to collect these pieces to both solve the problem on the planet and to MacGyver a spaceship so they can get off of the planet. This also acts as a form of race mechanic against the other factions, and as a way to delineate chapters within the world.

# Random Encounters
- GM Rolls a D20 every time the players move across the map. Every time the GM rolls a 16+, Random encounter time! Roll a D100 and check the following table on what random encounter occurs. [[Asteroids From Outer Heaven - Random Encounter List]]
