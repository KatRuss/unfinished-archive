# Landfall
After Act 0, the players crash land onto the region. The DM rolls 2d20 (For each player if going for a hardcore mode), each result is a coordinate in the gridmap. This is where the players crash land. The player characters are (thankfully) unharmed, despite having come in from space like an asteroid. Your mechs, however, are in pretty bad shape. Each sustaining an point in Structure Damage and one of their main systems is damaged beyond use (though can be repaired with enough scrap).
