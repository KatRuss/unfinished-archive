# What the fuck am I doing for it?
- ***Asteroids from Outer Heaven***
- Lancer hexcrawl, a 20x20 main map, about crashlanding on a desert planet after a tense outer-orbit battle that ends in the capital ship of the side their own gets nuked.
- The planet is interesting to the two factions (at the expense of the people living on it), because it secretly harbours a Rampant NHP, that is making alien technology while it's going insane.
